1. Get comfortable with damage simulations in Damask

Basically to set up a damage simulations i need to look at what parameters i need to consider for different damage models. Make geometry file an load file. 

2. Understand the theory for plasticity

3. Understand the theory for phase field damage

4. Understand the working of spectral solver in damask

5. Write a code from scratch to couple both crystal plasticity and phase field

A) Geometry to be taken from the fixed input file. Give the coordinate of all 64 points manually

B) boundary conditions need to be fixed and defined at nodes

C) solver ? 

D) stress response model from 
   a) elastic
   b) plastic
   c) damage


Need modules
1. vector
2. Tensor
3. Node
4. Element
5. Mesh
6. Elastic
7. Plastic
8. Damage
9. Solver main program

6. In Damask see how different parameters are effecting the simulation. Fix the damage model

7. Convergence of solution when we vary Interfacial energy or length lc
